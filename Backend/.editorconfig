# Suppress MA0016: Prefer using collection abstraction instead of implementation
# Record types use concrete List<T> for JSON serialization compatibility and API contracts

# Suppress MA0004: Use Task.ConfigureAwait(false)
# Azure Functions handles synchronization context appropriately

# Suppress MA0002: Use StringComparer overload
# Many LINQ operations on IDs don't require explicit comparer

# Suppress S2629: Don't use string concatenation in logging
# Performance impact is minimal in this context

# The == operator is readable and appropriate for simple string comparisons

# Suppress MA0011: Use CultureInfo with ToLower
# ToLowerInvariant is used where appropriate, ToLower is fine for display purposes

# Sometimes explicit loops are clearer
